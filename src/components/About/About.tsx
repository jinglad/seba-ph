                Patient Case | Pediatric Seizures

                A woman was diagnosed with breast cancer, and her diagnosis was
                confirmed by a pathologist at a major academic center in Boston.
                Her local care team was proceeding with radiation treatment when
                she decided she wanted a second opinion on the approach to her
                treatment. The Clinic collected her medical records and matched
                her with an expert Cleveland Clinic radiation oncologist. Her
                specialist and four additional pathologists concluded that an
                invasive component had been missed, resulting in a diagnosis
                change and revision to her treatment plan. The local treatment
                strategy would have undertreated her true condition and put her
                at risk of cancer spread. Through her second opinion, she
                received clarity on her diagnosis and the correct treatment
                path, greatly improving her ability to fight the cancer.Â
